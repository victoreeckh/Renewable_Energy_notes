- ## Intro
	- $H_2$ demand increased over the last 5 decades
	- Problem
	  collapsed:: true
		- Major problem: fluctuating power delivery from most renewables (nf-REES)
			- Need good integration in electric grid (adaptations required)
			- Storage of electricity?
		- Electricity storage (in large quantities) remains difficult issue
		- Future short-term storage likely via electric batteries (Li-ion)
		- Medium-term storage: Indirect storage via pump/turbine hydro
		- But LT / seasonal storage? -> via hydrogen (electrolysis/fuel cells) or electric power to synthetic methane (P2G)
	- Why excitement?
		- general
		  collapsed:: true
			- Current H2 usage basically as feedstock for industry
			- But H2 could be a clean fuel
				- for climate
					- no CO2 emitted by ‘end use’
					- no CO2 if ‘carefully’ produced
				- no local emissions (transportation & combustion in boilers or prime movers)
			- ~ 2000: To aid problem electricity storage – mainly for HEV (Hydrogen Electric Vehicles)
			  →electricity→electrolysis→H2→Fuel Cells→electricity
			- Now: To ‘solve’ overcapacity issue due to nf-REES/iREES/VREE in elec pwr sector &
			  LT (indirect) electric storage problem
			- Now: Realization that ‘all’ electric society is not likely; still molecules needed
				- Ships, aircrafts, long-haul trucks... but need liquid fuels based on hydrogen (and CCSU)
				- Sector coupling to help decarbonize transportation & heating sectors (incl industry) – H2 based liquid fuels
		- Origin
		  collapsed:: true
			- Interest for hydrogen originated from the renewable promoters
				- Hydrogen as a storage medium for (excess) electricity
			- Then hydrogen was adopted by the fossil fuel sector
				- Goes hand in hand with development of CCS (mostly through IGCCs – from synthesis gas H2 & CO+shift)
				- Fuel diversity – security of supply
			- other sectors followed
		- Hydrogen is not an energy source but a “carrier” / “vector”
		  collapsed:: true
			- Hydrogen must be produced from other (primary) sources
			- Absence of local emissions (important for transport)
			- Storable and transportable energy carrier
			- High conversion efficiencies potentially possible (fuel cells)
			- Allows integration of renewable, naturally fluctuating energy sources
			- Also applicable for transportation (fuel-cell vehicles)
	- Readings
		- Production and usage
			- Usage
			  collapsed:: true
				- 70Mt pure (only small level of additives) hydrogen
				- 45Mt as part of mixture gases
					- for methanol and steel production
			- production
			  collapsed:: true
				- Majority from fossil fuels
				- 60% produced in dedicated hydrogen facilities
					- Most from natural gas
					- Some from coal and small fraction electrolysis
				- 33% is "by-product"-hydrogen
					- comes from facilities and processes designed primarily to produce something else
				- only 0.7% from renewables or fossil fuel plants equipped with CCUS
			- Hydrogen value chain
			  collapsed:: true
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1684932022413_0.png){:height 275, :width 562}
		- Chemical energy carrier
			- similar to electricity
				- versatile
				- different applications
				- No emissions by usage
				- CO2 intensive upstream (production)
			- difference -
