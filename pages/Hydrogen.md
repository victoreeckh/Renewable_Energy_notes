- ## Intro
  collapsed:: true
	- $H_2$ demand increased over the last 5 decades
	- Problem
	  collapsed:: true
		- Major problem: fluctuating power delivery from most renewables (nf-REES)
			- Need good integration in electric grid (adaptations required)
			- Storage of electricity?
		- Electricity storage (in large quantities) remains difficult issue
		- Future short-term storage likely via electric batteries (Li-ion)
		- Medium-term storage: Indirect storage via pump/turbine hydro
		- But LT / seasonal storage? -> via hydrogen (electrolysis/fuel cells) or electric power to synthetic methane (P2G)
	- Why excitement?
		- general
		  collapsed:: true
			- Current H2 usage basically as feedstock for industry
			- But H2 could be a clean fuel
				- for climate
					- no CO2 emitted by ‘end use’
					- no CO2 if ‘carefully’ produced
				- no local emissions (transportation & combustion in boilers or prime movers)
			- ~ 2000: To aid problem electricity storage – mainly for HEV (Hydrogen Electric Vehicles)
			  →electricity→electrolysis→H2→Fuel Cells→electricity
			- Now: To ‘solve’ overcapacity issue due to nf-REES/iREES/VREE in elec pwr sector &
			  LT (indirect) electric storage problem
			- Now: Realization that ‘all’ electric society is not likely; still molecules needed
				- Ships, aircrafts, long-haul trucks... but need liquid fuels based on hydrogen (and CCSU)
				- Sector coupling to help decarbonize transportation & heating sectors (incl industry) – H2 based liquid fuels
		- Origin
		  collapsed:: true
			- Interest for hydrogen originated from the renewable promoters
				- Hydrogen as a storage medium for (excess) electricity
			- Then hydrogen was adopted by the fossil fuel sector
				- Goes hand in hand with development of CCS (mostly through IGCCs – from synthesis gas H2 & CO+shift)
				- Fuel diversity – security of supply
			- other sectors followed
		- Hydrogen is not an energy source but a “carrier” / “vector”
		  collapsed:: true
			- Hydrogen must be produced from other (primary) sources
			- Absence of local emissions (important for transport)
			- Storable and transportable energy carrier
			- High conversion efficiencies potentially possible (fuel cells)
			- Allows integration of renewable, naturally fluctuating energy sources
			- Also applicable for transportation (fuel-cell vehicles)
	- Readings
		- Production and usage
			- Usage
			  collapsed:: true
				- 70Mt pure (only small level of additives) hydrogen
				- 45Mt as part of mixture gases
					- for methanol and steel production
			- production
			  collapsed:: true
				- Majority from fossil fuels
				- 60% produced in dedicated hydrogen facilities
					- Most from natural gas
					- Some from coal and small fraction electrolysis
				- 33% is "by-product"-hydrogen
					- comes from facilities and processes designed primarily to produce something else
				- only 0.7% from renewables or fossil fuel plants equipped with CCUS

		- Chemical energy carrier
			- similar to electricity
			  collapsed:: true
				- versatile
				- different applications
				- No emissions by usage
				- CO2 intensive upstream (production)
			- difference -> chemical energy carrier
			  collapsed:: true
				- molecules not electrons
				- allows to be transported in a stable way
				- Add stock based element to flow based electricity system
				- Round-trip efficiency of H2 from electricity is only 30%
		- H2 vs H2 based fuels and feedstocks
		  collapsed:: true
			- H2 based fuels and feedstocks
				- H2 combined with other inputs
				- H2 produced from any source
		- P2X
		  collapsed:: true
			- Conversion of electricity to other energy carriers or chemicals, generally through hydrogen produced by the electrolysis of water
		- H2 categories
			- colors refer to different sources
			  collapsed:: true
				- black -> coal
				- grey -> natural gas
				- brown -> lignite
				- blue -> fossil fuels with CO2 emissions reduced by the use of CCUS
				- green -> from renewable electricity
				- turqoise -> pyrolysis
				- pink -> nuclear-electrolysis
			- CO2 content
		- relevant physical properties
			- high energy density per unit of mass
			  collapsed:: true
				- -> attractive as a transport fuel
			- low energy energy density per unit of volume
			  collapsed:: true
				- -> larger volumes need to be transported compared with other fuels
			- intermezzo LHV vs HHV
			  collapsed:: true
				- >The lower heating value (LHV) accounts for the heat released when a fuel is burned while considering that the water vapor produced during combustion remains in the gaseous state. It assumes that the water vapor in the exhaust is not condensed and the heat it contains is not recovered. This is the more conservative measure of energy content and represents the available energy after subtracting the heat carried away by water vapor. 
				  The higher heating value (HHV) takes into account the heat released during combustion as well as the latent heat of vaporization of water. It assumes that the water vapor produced during combustion is condensed and that the heat of condensation is recovered, which is not practically achievable in most applications. HHV includes the energy content of the water vapor formed during combustion, as it assumes complete condensation of the water vapor back to a liquid state. 
				  In practical terms, the LHV represents the available energy content that can be directly utilized in applications like power generation, while the HHV includes additional energy that is not practically recoverable. Therefore, LHV is typically the more commonly used value for practical purposes and comparing different fuels' energy content.
