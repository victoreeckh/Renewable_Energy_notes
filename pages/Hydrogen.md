- ## Intro
	- $H_2$ demand increased over the last 5 decades
	- Problem
	  collapsed:: true
		- Major problem: fluctuating power delivery from most renewables (nf-REES)
			- Need good integration in electric grid (adaptations required)
			- Storage of electricity?
		- Electricity storage (in large quantities) remains difficult issue
		- Future short-term storage likely via electric batteries (Li-ion)
		- Medium-term storage: Indirect storage via pump/turbine hydro
		- But LT / seasonal storage? -> via hydrogen (electrolysis/fuel cells) or electric power to synthetic methane (P2G)
	- Why excitement?
	  collapsed:: true
		- Current H2 usage basically as feedstock for industry
		- But H2 could be a clean fuel
			- for climate
				- no CO2 emitted by ‘end use’
				- no CO2 if ‘carefully’ produced
			- no local emissions (transportation & combustion in boilers or prime movers)
		- ~ 2000: To aid problem electricity storage – mainly for HEV (Hydrogen Electric Vehicles)
		  →electricity→electrolysis→H2→Fuel Cells→electricity
		- Now: To ‘solve’ overcapacity issue due to nf-REES/iREES/VREE in elec pwr sector &
		  LT (indirect) electric storage problem
		- Now: Realization that ‘all’ electric society is not likely; still molecules needed
			- Ships, aircrafts, long-haul trucks... but need liquid fuels based on hydrogen (and CCSU)
			- Sector coupling to help decarbonize transportation & heating sectors (incl industry) – H2 based liquid fuels
	- Origin
		- Interest for hydrogen originated from the renewable promoters
			- Hydrogen as a storage medium for (excess) electricity
		- Then hydrogen was adopted by the fossil fuel sector
			- Goes hand in hand with development of CCS (mostly through IGCCs – from synthesis gas H2 & CO+shift)
			- Fuel diversity – security of supply
		- other sectors followed
	- Hydrogen is not an energy source but a “carrier” / “vector”
		- Hydrogen must be produced from other (primary) sources
		- Absence of local emissions (important for transport)
		- Storable and transportable energy carrier
		- High conversion efficiencies potentially possible (fuel cells)
		- Allows integration of renewable, naturally fluctuating energy sources
		- Also applicable for transportation (fuel-cell vehicles)
