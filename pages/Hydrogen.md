- ## Intro
	- $H_2$ demand increased over the last 5 decades
	- Problem
		- Major problem: fluctuating power delivery from most renewables (nf-REES)
			- Need good integration in electric grid (adaptations required)
			- Storage of electricity?
		- Electricity storage (in large quantities) remains difficult issue
		- Future short-term storage likely via electric batteries (Li-ion)
		- Medium-term storage: Indirect storage via pump/turbine hydro
		- But LT / seasonal storage? -> via hydrogen (electrolysis/fuel cells) or electric power to synthetic methane (P2G)
