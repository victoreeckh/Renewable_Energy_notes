- ## Intro
  collapsed:: true
	- $H_2$ demand increased over the last 5 decades
	- Problem
	  collapsed:: true
		- Major problem: fluctuating power delivery from most renewables (nf-REES)
			- Need good integration in electric grid (adaptations required)
			- Storage of electricity?
		- Electricity storage (in large quantities) remains difficult issue
		- Future short-term storage likely via electric batteries (Li-ion)
		- Medium-term storage: Indirect storage via pump/turbine hydro
		- But LT / seasonal storage? -> via hydrogen (electrolysis/fuel cells) or electric power to synthetic methane (P2G)
	- Why excitement?
		- general
		  collapsed:: true
			- Current H2 usage basically as feedstock for industry
			- But H2 could be a clean fuel
				- for climate
					- no CO2 emitted by ‘end use’
					- no CO2 if ‘carefully’ produced
				- no local emissions (transportation & combustion in boilers or prime movers)
			- ~ 2000: To aid problem electricity storage – mainly for HEV (Hydrogen Electric Vehicles)
			  →electricity→electrolysis→H2→Fuel Cells→electricity
			- Now: To ‘solve’ overcapacity issue due to nf-REES/iREES/VREE in elec pwr sector &
			  LT (indirect) electric storage problem
			- Now: Realization that ‘all’ electric society is not likely; still molecules needed
				- Ships, aircrafts, long-haul trucks... but need liquid fuels based on hydrogen (and CCSU)
				- Sector coupling to help decarbonize transportation & heating sectors (incl industry) – H2 based liquid fuels
		- Origin
		  collapsed:: true
			- Interest for hydrogen originated from the renewable promoters
				- Hydrogen as a storage medium for (excess) electricity
			- Then hydrogen was adopted by the fossil fuel sector
				- Goes hand in hand with development of CCS (mostly through IGCCs – from synthesis gas H2 & CO+shift)
				- Fuel diversity – security of supply
			- other sectors followed
		- Hydrogen is not an energy source but a “carrier” / “vector”
		  collapsed:: true
			- Hydrogen must be produced from other (primary) sources
			- Absence of local emissions (important for transport)
			- Storable and transportable energy carrier
			- High conversion efficiencies potentially possible (fuel cells)
			- Allows integration of renewable, naturally fluctuating energy sources
			- Also applicable for transportation (fuel-cell vehicles)

			- high energy density per unit of mass
			  collapsed:: true
				- -> attractive as a transport fuel
			- low energy energy density per unit of volume
			  collapsed:: true
				- -> larger volumes need to be transported compared with other fuels
			- intermezzo LHV vs HHV
			  collapsed:: true
				- >The lower heating value (LHV) accounts for the heat released when a fuel is burned while considering that the water vapor produced during combustion remains in the gaseous state. It assumes that the water vapor in the exhaust is not condensed and the heat it contains is not recovered. This is the more conservative measure of energy content and represents the available energy after subtracting the heat carried away by water vapor. 
				  The higher heating value (HHV) takes into account the heat released during combustion as well as the latent heat of vaporization of water. It assumes that the water vapor produced during combustion is condensed and that the heat of condensation is recovered, which is not practically achievable in most applications. HHV includes the energy content of the water vapor formed during combustion, as it assumes complete condensation of the water vapor back to a liquid state. 
				  In practical terms, the LHV represents the available energy content that can be directly utilized in applications like power generation, while the HHV includes additional energy that is not practically recoverable. Therefore, LHV is typically the more commonly used value for practical purposes and comparing different fuels' energy content.

- ## Hydrogen from Renewable sources
  collapsed:: true
	- ### Introduction
	  collapsed:: true
		- Sole -> multi carrier
			- electrical RES wind and solar ‘intermittency’ and consequent overcapacities, with ample over-generation whilst also often deficiency of generation (‘Dunkelflaute’), integration of many sectors will likely be the rule: sector coupling
		- ultimate goal
			- Provide cheap and abundant energy carrier
				- that can easily be transported, stored and converted into end energy,
				- such that the overall cost of the energy chain is affordable,
				- so as to lead to end-energy conversion that is “clean” also for small-scale applications
		- Issues
			- production, transport, storage, safety
			- But mostly cost!
		- Fuel cell
			- Conversion: chemical -> electrical energy
			- Alkaline (AFC), proton exchange membrane (PEMFC), Phosphoric acid ( PAFC), Molten carbonide (MCFC), solid oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC)

	- ### Environmental impact and costs
		- Emissions
		- Cost evolution
		  collapsed:: true
			- Cost highly dependent on electricity price
		- Cost of large P2G systems / Sector Coupling
		  collapsed:: true
			- Correct cost metric for input electric energy:
				- LCOE = cost wind/solar (recovering investment cost)
			- Often argument: zero electricity prices because ‘zero marginal cost’ →input elec cost for electrolyzer = 0→this is a ‘dream’ (for long time to come)
			- Richard Green (Imperial college): H2 production via electrolysis increases elec demand → reinstates non-zero electricity price
