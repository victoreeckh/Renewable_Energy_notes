		- Increased importance
			- the growing share of renewable energy sources
				- Why renewables?
				  collapsed:: true
					- mismatch demand-supply in time and location
					- potential congestion of electricity grid
					- higher demand for flexibility, smart grid
					- the highly fluctuating electricity price (optimization towards minimal cost) and financial incentives
				- Role of storage in relation to renewables
				  collapsed:: true
					- Intermittent renewable energy sources (variable and difficult to
					  predict), e.g. solar thermal, PV, wind ...
					- Time shift towards consumption during off-peak periods and production during peak-periods, e.g. geothermal heat pump (consumption), biomass-fired-CHP (production) ...
					- Increasing performance (and thus reducing emissions) by less transient operation and less cycling, e.g. heat pumps, biomass boiler ...
					- Avoid problems of electricity grid infrastructure (voltage fluctuations), e.g. PV, heat pumps ...
			- more emphasis on energy conservation: residual heat recovery
		- Implies losses ($$\eta<1$$)

- ### TES - Sensible Storage
	- General
		- Heat is stored as internal energy, in the temperature increase of a medium (usually liquid or solid): $$Q = m\int_{T_1}^{T_2}c_p(T)dT$$
		- Temperature difference ($$\Delta T$$) drives the heat transfer; $$\Delta T$$ decreases while charging/discharging
		- Low energy storage density (large physical footprint); volumetric thermal capacity ($$c_p\rho$$) is important if space limitations
		- Power density can be limited by low thermal conductivity (solid) or low convective heat transfer rates (liquid) of some storage materials
		- State-of-the-art: well demonstrated, clearly understood, reliable, widely used, cheap
		- Considerable self discharge (heat losses) à insulation needed if high T or long storage times
