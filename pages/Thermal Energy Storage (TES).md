- ### Intro
	- #### Energy Storage
		- Increased importance
			- the growing share of renewable energy sources
				- Why renewables?
				  collapsed:: true
					- mismatch demand-supply in time and location
					- potential congestion of electricity grid
					- higher demand for flexibility, smart grid
					- the highly fluctuating electricity price (optimization towards minimal cost) and financial incentives
				- Role of storage in relation to renewables
				  collapsed:: true
					- Intermittent renewable energy sources (variable and difficult to
					  predict), e.g. solar thermal, PV, wind ...
					- Time shift towards consumption during off-peak periods and production during peak-periods, e.g. geothermal heat pump (consumption), biomass-fired-CHP (production) ...
					- Increasing performance (and thus reducing emissions) by less transient operation and less cycling, e.g. heat pumps, biomass boiler ...
					- Avoid problems of electricity grid infrastructure (voltage fluctuations), e.g. PV, heat pumps ...
			- more emphasis on energy conservation: residual heat recovery
		- Implies losses ($$\eta<1$$)
		- Types
			- TES
			- Electrical Energy Storage (EES)
			- Power-to-Heat, Power-to-Cold + TES
	- #### TES
		- *TES is a technology that stores thermal energy by heating or cooling a storage medium so that the stored energy can be used later for heating and cooling applications or power generation*
		- Offers flexiblity
			- Demand shifting
			- Variable supply integration
			- Sector integration
			- Network management
			- Seasonal storage
		- Sectors
			- Power
			- Buildings
			- District heating and cooling
			- Cold chain
			- Industry
		- Energy density
			- TCM (thermochemical materials)> PCM (phase changing materials)> water
		- TES selection
			- Temperature range
			- Storage density (space limited?)
			- Long versus short term
			- Application scale: decentralized versus centralized
			- Cost
			- Applicability â€“ market readiness
				- Sensible: fully developed
				- Latent: improvements in thermal conductivity still needed
				- Thermochemical:
					- sorption is applied
					- chemical reaction in demonstration phase
