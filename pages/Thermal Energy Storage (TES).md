		- Increased importance
			- the growing share of renewable energy sources
				- Why renewables?
				  collapsed:: true
					- mismatch demand-supply in time and location
					- potential congestion of electricity grid
					- higher demand for flexibility, smart grid
					- the highly fluctuating electricity price (optimization towards minimal cost) and financial incentives
				- Role of storage in relation to renewables
				  collapsed:: true
					- Intermittent renewable energy sources (variable and difficult to
					  predict), e.g. solar thermal, PV, wind ...
					- Time shift towards consumption during off-peak periods and production during peak-periods, e.g. geothermal heat pump (consumption), biomass-fired-CHP (production) ...
					- Increasing performance (and thus reducing emissions) by less transient operation and less cycling, e.g. heat pumps, biomass boiler ...
					- Avoid problems of electricity grid infrastructure (voltage fluctuations), e.g. PV, heat pumps ...
			- more emphasis on energy conservation: residual heat recovery
		- Implies losses ($$\eta<1$$)

- ### TES - Sensible Storage
	- General
		- Heat is stored as internal energy, in the temperature increase of a medium (usually liquid or solid): $$Q = m\int_{T_1}^{T_2}c_p(T)dT$$
		- Temperature difference ($$\Delta T$$) drives the heat transfer; $$\Delta T$$ decreases while charging/discharging
		- Low energy storage density (large physical footprint); volumetric thermal capacity ($$c_p\rho$$) is important if space limitations
		- Power density can be limited by low thermal conductivity (solid) or low convective heat transfer rates (liquid) of some storage materials
		- State-of-the-art: well demonstrated, clearly understood, reliable, widely used, cheap
		- Considerable self discharge (heat losses) à insulation needed if high T or long storage times
	- Materials
		- Low cost:
			- Water: best choice in T range 20-80°C
			- Solid state: soil, rocks
		- Higher cost:
			- Oil: for higher temperatures
			- Salt solutions (brines):when old salt mines (caverns) are used as storage tanks and flooded
			- Blocks or plates of different solid materials (graphite, concrete, iron, iron oxide ...)
			- Molten salts
	- Types
		- Water
			- Characteristics
				- the best choice in T range 20-80°C
				- High thermal capacity (4.2kJ/kgK)
				- (-) Low cost
				- (-) Limited temperature range, but appropriate for building applications and for connection with solar thermal
				- High convective heat transfer rate
					- High heat injection and extraction rates
					- Makes stratification more difficult (because of mixing)
			- Configurations
				- ==Water tanks== (TTES)
					- Immersed coil heat exchanger
						- Generally located at bottom of tank (profit from high $$\Delta T$$, HT easier when $$\Delta T$$ is higher)
						- Mixed tank (not stratified)
					- External (side-arm) heat exchanger
						- Natural convection HEx to eliminate a circulation pump
						- Potential for increasing thermal stratification in tank
					- Mantle heat exchanger
						- Double walled storage tank, heat transfer fluid circulated through the storage mantle
						- Large heat transfer surface area
						- More costly
				- ==Aquifer== (ATES)
					- Working
						- Wells are used to carry (ground) water to/from the aquifer, allowing transport of heat
						- Cold and warm wells (distance 50-250m)
					- Characteristics
						- Potential for economical large scale and long term (seasonal) storage
						- Amount of energy stored depends on allowable temperature change, thermal conductivity, natural ground water flow
