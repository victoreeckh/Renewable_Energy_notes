- ### context
	- BIPV
		- Building Integrated Photovoltaics
		- Integrate PV cells/modules in structural building elements
		- <->BAPV (building applied voltaics): Placed on existing structures
	- Why?
		- Climate awareness
			- Reduce the use of fossil fuels and increase the share of renewable energy generation
		- Legislation
			- EPBD (European
			  Performance on Buildings Directive), SET plan (Strategic Energy Technology)
		- Cost
			- Higher CAPEX but lower OPEX
			- Material savings
		- Image
			- Green building
		- Roof space
			- Can be scarce in urban areas
			- Too small to cover buildingâ€™s energy demand
	- Build-up
		- BIPVs all connected to ==Module Level Converters== (MLC)
			- Module level MPPT
				- Why?
					- High partial shading risk
					- Allows to use modules with different ratings
					- converter pre-installment -> cost reduction
				- Leads to higher efficiency
			-
		- MLCs all connected in parallel to ==Low Voltage DC== (LVDC)
- Research question and methodology
- Case study
- Conclusions
