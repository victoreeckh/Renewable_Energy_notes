- ### Wind farms
  id:: 64383153-7fdc-48b9-8eaa-9f943c8d370b
	- Turbines can interact with each other (7% of the energy flux left in the wake)
	- Wind farm models
		- Understanding interactions within the farm
			- CFD simulations
			- The more certain your models, the higher the amount of money is that the banks will be willing to lend
		- But for design and planning
			- Computationally expensive (million designs need to be tested etc.)
			- Trade-off between fidelity and cost for models
	- Example
		- 1/4
			- Biggest thrustforce (biggest thrustcoefficient) is at rated windspeed
				- e.g. **Exam Q:** *What is the Torque on the foundation?* #Exam
					- Look at Thrust coefficient at rated wind speed
			- Windspeed$$\nearrow$$ -> wake defict$$\searrow$$
				- Because $$C_T \searrow$$ and ($$C_T \rightarrow a$$, and $$2a$$ in the wake)
		- 2/4
			- How many turbines?
				- Vary density
		- 3/4
			- Efficiency drops for denser farms
			- Weight this with
		- 4/4
			- Denser farms
				- Have higher capacity
				- But at lower capacity factors
	- Wind farm control
		- Quasi static control
			- Not fast control
			- Examples
				- Axial induction control
					- Feather blades of turbines in front for the ones in the back to pick up more power
						- Doesn't work: power picked up is always more than power lost
				- Yaw control
					- Intentionally misalign the turbine
					- To divert the wake to the outside
				- Floating turbines
					- Higher CapEx/OpEx
		- Dynamic Induction control
			- Helix control
				- Increase wake mixing
			- Pulse control
	- Windfarm blocking
		- Root cause still open for debate. Two main hypothesis:
			- “Hydrodynamic” blockage (possibly + stable stratification)
			- Gravity waves
