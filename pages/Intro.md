- ## The role of renewables
	- ### Challenges
		- low energy / power density
		  collapsed:: true
			- much place and many devices needed
		- PV & wind unpredictable; possibly out of phase with demand
		  collapsed:: true
			- storage needed or back up
		- Could be ‘costly’, partly because of above mentioned issues
		- Role in context with other sources, e.g., CCUS or nuclear
		- Not quite totally environmentally friendly:
		  collapsed:: true
			- indirect CO2 emissions, large hydro, birds, noise, visual, ...
		- non-centralized generation
		  collapsed:: true
			- creates potential issues for the grid: harmonics, reactive power control ->power electronics... cost of system integration
			- centralized generation can be better controlled; e.g., environmental “clean up”
			  stoves with biomass ↔ centralized boilers
		- liberalization energy markets
		  collapsed:: true
			- integration/compatibility in liberalized markets? Subsidized?
			- they cannibalize each other by driving down wholesale electricity prices
	- ### Objective reasons
		- (Cheap) fossil fuels will be exhausted in time
		  collapsed:: true
			- -> need alternatives (eventually)
		- Because of enhanced greenhouse effect,
		  collapsed:: true
			- we must abandon fossil fuels ‘resolutely’
			- ->need alternatives ‘quickly’ (next decades)
		- Geopolitical (in-)stability & energy security
		  collapsed:: true
			- recent oil & gas price fluctuations (volatility)
			- ->should encourage development indigenous sources
		- Other sources (esp fossil –e.g. coal) only appear cheap! ->Must include external costs
		  collapsed:: true
			- ->renewables/alternatives much “cheaper”; competitive with internalized fossil costs
			- -> leaves renewable & nuclear routes (& fossils with CCUS possibly for a limited time)
			- winners will be determined by ‘full scope economics’:
				- external (environmental) costs
				- private (investment & fuel) costs... affordability
				- be careful with distributional effects...
				- but beware of ‘surprises’ – DAC, CO2 sequestration in minerals, ...
	- ### What is the long-term solution?
		- Energy Efficiency
		  collapsed:: true
			- historically ~ 1%/a decrease energy intensity
			- future perhaps ~ 2%/a decrease
			- But welfare is increasing ...
			- So energy efficiency is very valuable, but likely insufficient (especially from global perspective)
		- Renewables
		  collapsed:: true
			- have a high theoretical energy potential
				- RES are getting boost due to recent dramatic cost reductions (esp PV)
				- but still many challenges (technical, economic,...) for market integration
				- will need coherent policies & market designs
				- ->uncertainties in short & long term (dependent on the countries & energy systems)
		- Energy efficiency & renewables
		  collapsed:: true
			- to be pursued with all “reasonable” means; concentrate on “wise” integration of RES in the system & concentrate on flexibility & appropriate market designs.
			- But keep other options alive (nuclear fission, natural gas + CCUS, and develop new concepts via R&D e.g., fusion); do not overreact, be cost-effective & save capital for investments in energy transition.
			- **Be ambitious but realistic**
				- Plan / consider ‘timely’ phase out of fossil fuels; do not act blindly; current economies are built upon fossil fuels; and need natural gas as transition fuel for flexibility.
- ## Renewable flows, conversion, conventions
- ### Characteristics
	- ==Capacity factor== (or load factor) [-]
		- $CF = \frac{\int_0^{8760}Pdt}{P_{inst}\cdot 8760 h}$
		- *the ratio of the actual output of the plant over a period of time to its maximum possible output if it were running at full capacity during that same period of time. It is usually expressed as a percentage and is a measure of how efficiently the plant is operating over that time period*
	- ==Effective Number of Operating Hours== (ENOH) [h]
		- $ENOH = \frac{\int_0^{8760}Pdt}{P_{inst}} = CF\cdot 8760h$
		- *The effective number of hours the plant should run at full capacity to equal its yearly output in MWh*
