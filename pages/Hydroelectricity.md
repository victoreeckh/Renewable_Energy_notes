- ### Land-based Hydro Power
	- #### Intro
		- **Dams**
			- Why build?
				- Water collection: drinking water, agriculture
				- Flood control
				- Energy production / storage
		- **Water availability**
			- Seasonal
				- river regimes
			- Water cycle
				- evaporation -> precipitation
			- High percentages of technical feasible hydropower developments in EU/N-A
		- **Problems**
			- Droughts
				- e.g.: Folsom lake
			- Build
				- Concrete -> lot of CO2 emissions
			- Biodiversity decrease
				- Loss of CO2 retainments by these declined biotopes
			- International conflicts
				- (In region with potential availability)
				- Ethiopia, Sudan Egypt
				- Brazil
		- **Types**

	- #### Large-scale Hydro Power
		- use natural sources (geographical opportunities)
			- Rivers
			- Lakes
			- Dams (e.g. build for drinking/irrigation water retention)
		- Reservoirs
			- Energy conversion: $$E_{}$$
			- Types
				- Mountain power
