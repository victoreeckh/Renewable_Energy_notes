- ### Land-based Hydro Power
	- #### Intro
		- **Dams**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Why build?
				- Water collection: drinking water, agriculture
				- Flood control
				- Energy production / storage
		- **Water availability**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Seasonal
				- river regimes
			- Water cycle
				- evaporation -> precipitation
			- High percentages of technical feasible hydropower developments in EU/N-A
		- **Problems**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Droughts
				- e.g.: Folsom lake
			- Build
				- Concrete -> lot of CO2 emissions
			- Biodiversity decrease
				- Loss of CO2 retainments by these declined biotopes
			- International conflicts
				- (In region with potential availability)
				- Ethiopia, Sudan Egypt
				- Brazil
		- **Types**

	- #### Large-scale Hydro Power
		- use natural sources (geographical opportunities)
			- Rivers
			- Lakes
			- Dams (e.g. build for drinking/irrigation water retention)
		- Turbines used
			- ==Kaplan==
				- Specifiek toerental: $$n_s = n\frac{Q^{1/2}}{H^{3/4}}>2$$
					- For low height drop (hydraulic head), typically in a river
					- Large flow rate
				- Reaction turbine
				- Low revolution speed
					- ->High torques
					- -> Big sizes
					- ->Build vertical (otherwise bends under own weight)
				- e.g. ship (pumpvariant)
			- ==Francis==
				- Specifiek toerental: $$0.3<n_s<2$$
					- hydr. head $$H$$ of 10m to 100s m
				- Inwards reaction turbine
					- Tangential in, axial out
					- with decreasing diameter (-> water squeezed out)
				- (+) Large efficiency
				- (+) popular
			- ==Pelton==
				- Specifiek toerental: $$n_s<0.3$$
					- large hydr. head
					- relatively small flow rate
				- Impulse turbine
				- Large revolution speed
				- (-) less popular
		- Type
			- ==Reservoirs==
				- Energy conversion: $$E_{pot}\rightarrow E_{kin} \rightarrow E_{elec}$$
				- Subypes
					- Mountain power plant
				- (+) controllable
			- ==Run-of-River==
				- Energy conversion: $$E_{kin} \rightarrow E_{elec}$$
				- Subtypes
					- Power plant in plains
					- Power plant in plain, but with relatively large height drop due to bend
						- Natural waterfall
						- e.g. Niagara
