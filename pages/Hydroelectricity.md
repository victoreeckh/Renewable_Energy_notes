	- #### Large-scale Hydro Power
	  collapsed:: true
		- use natural sources (geographical opportunities)
			- Rivers
			- Lakes
			- Dams (e.g. build for drinking/irrigation water retention)
		- Turbines used
			- ==Kaplan==
				- Specifiek toerental: $$n_s = n\frac{Q^{1/2}}{H^{3/4}}>2$$
					- For low height drop (hydraulic head), typically in a river
					- Large flow rate
				- Reaction turbine
				- Low revolution speed
					- ->High torques
					- -> Big sizes
					- ->Build vertical (otherwise bends under own weight)
				- application
					- Run of the river
				- e.g. ship (pumpvariant)
			- ==Francis==
				- Specifiek toerental: $$0.3<n_s<2$$
					- hydr. head $$H$$ of 10m to 100s m
				- Inwards reaction turbine
					- Tangential in, axial out
					- with decreasing diameter (-> water squeezed out)
				- Applications
					- Big dams
				- (+) Large efficiency
				- (+) popular
			- ==Pelton==
				- Specifiek toerental: $$n_s<0.3$$
					- large hydr. head
					- relatively small flow rate
				- Impulse turbine
				- Large revolution speed
				- (-) less popular
		- Generators used
			- Salient-pole synchronous machines
				- Physical speed is proportional to grid frequency
				- Turbines turn at slow speed -> High amount of poles needed ($$n=\frac{f}{p_1}$$; repeat magnetic field)
				- rotor spins at fixed speed -> induces voltage in stator windings -> AC voltage in stator
				- Vertical positioning because of size
		- Type

				- Subypes
					- Mountain power plant
				- (+) controllable
			- ==Run-of-River==

				- Subtypes
					- Power plant in plains
					- Power plant in plain, but with relatively large height drop due to bend
						- Natural waterfall
						- e.g. Niagara
			- ==Pumped Hydro Power==
				- = reversible turbine/generator, can pump/motor
				- Typically closed water system (not on river)
				- Use: balancing, arbitrage, black-start
				- See Storage section
		- CBA
		  collapsed:: true
			- Sustainability
				- (-) evaporation
				- (-) No seasonal change
					- affects agriculture and fertilizations downstream
					- -> use flood control (flush the valley)
				- (-) Sedimentation, clogging in the reservoir, upstream dam
				- (-) Biodiversity issues
					- regular submersion of wetlands

				- (-) Population impact
					- e.g. Three Gorges Dam, 1.24M people had to move
				- (-) Earthquake risks due to weight on earth crust?
				- (-) Political conflicts
					- E.g. Mekong delta, GERD in Ethiopia
	- #### Small-scale Hydro Power
	  collapsed:: true
		- Concept
			- Locally control problematic side-effects
			- A small-scale hydroelectric facility requires that a sizable flow of water and an adequate head of water is available without building elaborate and expensive
			  facilities.
			- Small hydroelectric plants can be developed at existing dams and have been constructed in connection with water level control of rivers, lakes and irrigation schemes.
			- By using existing structures, only minor new civil engineering works are required, which reduces the cost of this component of a development
		- Types
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1682182180968_0.png)
		- Turbines
			- Type determined by
				- Rate of water flow
				- Height of waterdrop (hydraulic head)
				- The turbine must also rotate at a speed that conforms to a synchronous generator speed
			- Types
				- Radial flow type
					- Francis
				- Axial flow type
					- Kaplan
					- Propellor
				- Impulse turbine
					- Pelton
					- Banki/Crossflow
		- Waterwheels
			- Types
				- Undershot
				- Overshot (Also pitchback)
				- Breastshot
			- Not full potential can be used
				- As it hurts fish population -> fish ladders/elevators
		- CBA
			- Advantages
				- (+) They do not need much space
				- (+) They rarely cause shoreline flooding
				- (+) Avoids problems of building big hydro power plants
				- (+) Reduces risks of fuel supplies
				- (+) Supply of low-cost electric energy
				- (+) Stable price (local production) not influenced by international market
				- (+) More economic benefits to the region (employment,...)
				- (+) Opportunity for wealth creation in not developed areas
			- Disadvantages
				- (-) Special cold climate requirements
				- (-) They have to provide fish protections where needed
				- (-) Higher costs due to not standardized purchase contracts and interconnection requirements
				- (-) The regulations focus more on large-scale hydroelectric issues than on small-scale hydroelectric issues that sometimes impose disproportionate demands on small hydroelectric developers.
### Ocean Energy
	- #### Tidal energy
		- *relative motion of the water due gravitational forces (Earth-Moon interaction)*
			- Periodicity is not equal to the periodicity of electricity demand
		- Concept
			- Barrage in river or bay withholding water (need sufficient tide amplitude): potential energy
				- Similar to dams: catch water when it's high-tide and release on low tide
			- Turbines in stream: kinetic energy
		- (-) Hydraulic head $$H$$ limited to ±6m
		- (-) Periodicity: need to wait for at least 6h to refill
		- Conclusion
			- not interesting/not a lot of potential
	- #### Ocean/Sea (under water) flow energy
		- Underwater turbines
		- Concept
			- Wind turbine designed for water
		- CBA
		  collapsed:: true
			- (+) known technology
			- (+) water is about 800 times denser than air, no need for big systems to get a lot of energy out of it
			- (-) water is about 800 times denser than air, tidal stream turbines have to be much sturdier than wind turbines
			- (-) Places where streams are highest, are the deepest
				- -> difficult to capitalize on the sweetspots
				- -> floating structures?
		- Conclusion
			- Potential only found far (and deep) from coast
	- #### Wave energy
		- *waves due to wind blowing over the surface of the ocean*
		- Concept
			- Capture motion by
				- Bending device on surface
					- Pelamis machines at Aguçadoura Wave Farm (Portugal): hydraulic motors drive el. generators
				- Channel waves (or tidal flow over dam) into basin and release over turbine: “overtopping”
				- Floating devices attached to seabed
					- Wavestar
					- Flansea buoy: linear movement converted into rotation via cable, then drive electrical generator
				- Oscillating water column
					- e.g. Oyster
					- Oscillating Water Column: compress air, drive turbine on-shore
		- CBA
			- (+) close to shore/shallow period
			- (-) still low frequency
			- (-) Low energy density
			- (-) reliability
			- (-) grid connection
	- #### Ocean thermal energy
		- *Use temperature differences between surface and deep sea water*
		- (-) You need enough depth to create sufficient temperature difference (-> not suitable for North sea)
	- #### Osmotic power
		- *Salinity gradient power energy retrieved from the difference in the salt concentration between seawater and (fresh) river water*
		- Types
			- ==reverse electrodialysis== (RED)
				- uses battery principles
			- ==pressure retarded osmosis== (PRO)
				- seawater and fresh water are separated by a membrane
				- the seawater draws the fresh water through the membrane, thereby increasing the pressure on the seawater side
				- the increased pressure is used to produce power (turbine)
				- result: brackish water
			- (-) not mature (still low output)
	- #### Offshore wind
		- ((64383153-7fdc-48b9-8eaa-9f943c8d370b))
		- (+) mature

	- #### Floating PV
		- ((6433cf73-e525-4b5e-9a81-819710a07ce1))
		- ((6436524d-4027-413c-bbb2-41416a997123)) are used
			- Not that much reflection from the water in reality (Ocean close to black body, optically)
		- (+) Better performance due to cooling effect (15% more yield)
		- (+) Limit evaporation
		- (-) Movements (MPPT)!
		- (-) Storms?
		- (-) Corrosion?
		- (-) Grid connection?
