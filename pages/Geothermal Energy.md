- Deep Geothermal Energy
- ### Intro
	- Thermal energy (“heat”) of the earth
		- Primordialheat–earthformation
		- Decay of long-lived radioactive isotopes
	- Energy extraction from crust
		- Up to~10km
		- Temperature gradient
	- Source that can be used as baseload (<->intermittent)
- ### Geothermal resource exploitation
	- #### Resource classification
		- Mostly via hydrothermal system
		- Viable hydrothermal geothermal resource
			- Supply of water > water presence
			- Overlying layer of impervious rock > high pressure source
			- Permeable reservoir > allows water seeping through
			- Large heat source > causes T-gradient
			- Reliable recharge mechanism > lifetime
		- classification
			- Water-dominated fields
				- Hot water <100°C
				- Wet steam >100°C
			- Vapor-dominated fields
		- Enhanced/Engineered geothermal system (EGS)
			- No geothermal reservoir needed
			- increase permeability
