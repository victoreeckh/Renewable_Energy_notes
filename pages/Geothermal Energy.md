- Deep Geothermal Energy
- ### Intro
	- Thermal energy (“heat”) of the earth
		- Primordialheat–earthformation
		- Decay of long-lived radioactive isotopes
	- Energy extraction from crust
		- Up to~10km
		- Temperature gradient
	- Source that can be used as baseload (<->intermittent)
- ### Geothermal resource exploitation
	- #### Resource classification
		- Mostly via hydrothermal system
		- Viable hydrothermal geothermal resource
		  collapsed:: true
			- characteristics
			  collapsed:: true
				- Supply of water > water presence
				- Overlying layer of impervious rock > high pressure source
				- Permeable reservoir > allows water seeping through
				- Large heat source > causes T-gradient
				- Reliable recharge mechanism > lifetime
			- classification
			  collapsed:: true
				- Water-dominated fields
					- Hot water <100°C
					- Wet steam >100°C
				- Vapor-dominated fields
		- Enhanced/Engineered geothermal system (EGS)
		  collapsed:: true
			- No geothermal reservoir needed
			- increase permeability
			- How?
			  collapsed:: true
				- Rocks are fractioned (hydro-fractioned)
				- Fluid at high pressure + chemicals -> subsurface heat exchanger
			- But
			  collapsed:: true
				- Loss of fluid
				- Risk of earthquakes -> proper reservoir modeling needed
				- Environmental issues
			- No mature technology
	- #### Location
		- near plate tectonics
	- #### Applications
		- Heating
			- Indirect: ground-coupled heat pump (shallow-geoth.)
			- Direct: houses, industrial processes, swimming pools, greenhouses, ...
		- Electricity generation
			- Dry-steampowerplants
			- Flash powerplants
			- Binary powerplants
		- Cooling
			- Absorption chillers
			- Adsorption chillers
