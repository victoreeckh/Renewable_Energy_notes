- ### Intro
	- Global challenge
		- Energy security while
			- Mitigate global warming -> decarbonization
			- Reducing air pollution
		- Safe and clean energy
		- Renewable energy generation increases
			- Global: larger hydropower trend
	- **Idea**: *Energy production largely dependent on atmospheric conditions*
		- Wind energy: windspeed
		- Solar energy: clouds, pollution, haze (optical depth atmosphere), temperature
		- Hydropower: Precipitation, evaporation
		- Biomass: precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration affect growth
- ### Why, when and where is it windy?
	- General circulation
		- No rotation
			- convection cells driven by $$T$$ gradient
		- Rotation
			- Coriolis acceleration
				- Deflection of the wind
			- Structure (Per hemisphere)
				- Hadley cell
				- Forell Cell
				- Polar cell
	- Geostrophic wind
		- Forces
			- Pressure gradient force
				- Acceleration of the air package
				- Why doesn't the air flow from high to low pressure? <- Coriolis force
					- Deflection (to the right on the N hemi)
				- High pressure system
					- clock wise flow
				- Low pressure system
					- Anti-clock wise flow
			- Coriolis force
				- apparent deviation to the right for counterclockwise rotation
		- Equation
			- Synoptetische schaal: $$\sum F = F_D +F_C =0 \Rightarrow V_g = \frac{1}{\rho f}\frac{\partial p}{\partial n}$$
