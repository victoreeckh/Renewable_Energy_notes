- ### Intro
	- Global challenge
		- Energy security while
			- Mitigate global warming -> decarbonization
			- Reducing air pollution
		- Safe and clean energy
		- Renewable energy generation increases
			- Global: larger hydropower trend
	- **Idea**: *Energy production largely dependent on atmospheric conditions*
		- Wind energy: windspeed
		- Solar energy: clouds, pollution, haze (optical depth atmosphere), temperature
		- Hydropower: Precipitation, evaporation
		- Biomass: precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration affect growth
- ### Why, when and where is it windy?
