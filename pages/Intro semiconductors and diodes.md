- ## Semiconductors
	- Energy bands in semiconductors
		- Discrete energy levels of electrons disappear when atoms are placed in a crystal structure (energy bands are consequence of crystal periodicity)
	- Occupation probability of energy states
		- $T=0^\circ K$ => all energy levels are filled up to the Fermilevel ($E_f$)
		- $T>0^\circ K$ => electrons are excited to higher levels, according to the Fermi-Dirac distribution function f(E)
			- $f(E) = \frac{1}{1+exp[(E-E_f)/kT]}$
		- Energy levels above Ef have a small but finite probability to be occupied by an electron, whereas energy levels below Ef have a small but finite probability to be empty
