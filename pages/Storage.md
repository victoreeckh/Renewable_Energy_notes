- ### Overview and general characteristics
  collapsed:: true
	- Why needed?
		- Solve electrical imbalance in space and time
		- Flexibility needed to equate demand with supply
			- Flexible demand
				- Flatten demand curve
				- By increasing self consumption
					- Of PV
					- with tariffs (direct)
			- flexible supply
	- Categorize technologies regarding
		- conversion process
		- Energy vs Power
		- Application

		- Maturity
	- Efficiency
		- Every conversion in the system yields a kind of efficiency
- ### Mechanical storage
	- #### Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS)
		- Position of body of water in gravitational field
		- Pure and mixed
		- Power pumping â‰  turbine
		- Roundtrip efficiency 65-85%
		- Most often in HV grid
		- Asset of producers in liberalized market
