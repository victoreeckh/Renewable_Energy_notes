- ### Overview and general characteristics
  collapsed:: true
	- Why needed?
		- Solve electrical imbalance in space and time
		- Flexibility needed to equate demand with supply
			- Flexible demand
				- Flatten demand curve
				- By increasing self consumption
					- Of PV
					- with tariffs (direct)
			- flexible supply
	- Categorize technologies regarding
		- conversion process
		- Energy vs Power
		- Application

			- Very important picture!
		- Location
			- Central vs distributed?

		- Maturity
	- Efficiency
		- Every conversion in the system yields a kind of efficiency
- ### Mechanical storage
	- #### Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS)
		- General
			- Position of body of water in gravitational field
			- Pure and mixed
			- Power pumping ≠ turbine
			- Roundtrip efficiency 65-85%
			- Most often in HV grid
			- Asset of producers in liberalized market
			- Energy: $$\Delta E_{pot} = \rho\cdot g\cdot \Delta h\cdot V$$
				- Big heights $$\Delta h$$ (e.g. mountains)
				- Big lakes $$V$$
			- Power: $$P = \rho\cdot g\cdot \Delta h\cdot Q\cdot \eta$$
		- Roll out
			- together with Nuclear
				- complimentary flexibility
		- Potential
			- Sizable potential still
			- Geographically limited
			- Of limited use with congestion issues
			- Not really long-term (security of supply context)
			- Limited power control flexibility (pumping), specifically around 0 MW (dewatering)
		- Energy island
			- ((644434c5-a6be-4994-a54a-906bc62b063b))
			- Recently proposed project
			- Proven (mature) technology in a new innovative context
			- • Facilita:ngtheintegra:onofoffshorewindpower
			  • FutureoffshoreSupergridbuildingblock
