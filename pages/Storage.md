- ### Overview and general characteristics
  collapsed:: true
	- Why needed?
		- Solve electrical imbalance in space and time
		- Flexibility needed to equate demand with supply
			- Flexible demand
				- Flatten demand curve
				- By increasing self consumption
					- Of PV
					- with tariffs (direct)
			- flexible supply
	- Categorize technologies regarding
		- conversion process
		- Energy vs Power
		- Application

		- Maturity
	- Efficiency
		- Every conversion in the system yields a kind of efficiency
- ### Mechanical storage
	- #### Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS)
		- General
			- Position of body of water in gravitational field
			- Pure and mixed
			- Power pumping ≠ turbine
			- Roundtrip efficiency 65-85%
			- Most often in HV grid
			- Asset of producers in liberalized market
			- Energy: $$\Delta E_{pot} = \rho\cdot g\cdot \Delta h\cdot V$$
				- Big heights $$\Delta h$$ (e.g. mountains)
				- Big lakes $$V$$
			- Power: $$P = \rho\cdot g\cdot \Delta h\cdot Q\cdot \eta$$
		- Roll out
			- together with Nuclear
				- complimentary flexibility
		- Potential
			- Sizable potential still
			- Geographically limited
			- Of limited use with congestion issues
			- Not really long-term (security of supply context)
			- Limited power control flexibility (pumping), specifically around 0 MW (dewatering)
		- Energy island
			- ((644434c5-a6be-4994-a54a-906bc62b063b))
			- Recently proposed project (JD: will never be built)
			- Proven (mature) technology in a new innovative context
			- Facilitating the integration of off shore wind power
			- Future off shore Supergrid building block
	- #### CAES
		- = Compressed Air Energy Storage
		- used for storing energy by compressing air into an underground reservoir or storage tank with use of a compressor, which can be released later to generate electricity using a turbine.
		- Often combined with Gas plant
		- CBA
			- (+) Low capital cost (integrated in CCGT plant)
			- (-) Need for natural cavity (typically salt cavern)
			- (-) Lower round trip efficiency
				- Energy lost to the boundaries of the cavern
			- (-) Depends on presence of gas turbines and natural gas pipeline
		- Adiabatic Compressed Air Storage
			- Same but in combination with heat storage to increase efficiency
			- the compressed air is heated before it is stored and cooled before it is expanded through a turbine to generate electricity
	- #### Flywheel
		- Storage of kinetic energy, by rotation of large inertia
		- High speeds
			- Special generators/motors needed
		- Vacuum
		- Heavy inertia
		- Magnetic bearings
		- (+)Fast charge/discharge
			- high Power/low Energy
		- Applications
			- Not in renewable energy
			- Maybe in exotic applications like CERN
			- Supercapacitors took over the market that flywheels were occupying 20years ago
- ### Electromagnetic Storage
	- #### Supercapacitors
		- *A supercapacitor or an ultracapacitor is an electrochemical capacitor that has an unusually large amount of energy storage capability relative to its size when compared to common capacitors.*
		- Concept
			- Electrostatic: low capacitance, no electrolyte, insulating material in between electrodes: mica, teflon, ceramic, ...
			- Electrolytic: “Elco”, DC-link energy storage, high single cell voltage compared to EDLC, high capacitance compared to electrostatic caps, inherently polar
		- CBA
			- ()Very high rates of charge and discharge.
			- Little degradation over hundreds of thousands of cycles.
			- High cycle efficiency (95% or more) due to its low equivalent
			  series resistance (ESR)
