- ### Main types of turbines
	- Descriptive
	- sl.28-31 lezen
	- Wind turbine types
		- This course covers Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT)
		- Other: Darrieus, Savonius, Gorlov
	- High altitude wind power
	- Generator types
		- Constant speed generator (first turbines)
			- Both possible with asynchronous or synchronous generators
			- Not optimal with respect to power extraction etc.
				- Can sometimes act as a fan
		- Variable speed with asynchronous generator
			- DFIG: Doubly Fed Induction Generator
			- Asynchronous generator and gearbox (Dominant generator today)
			- Generator with direct drive
				- No gearbox
				- Enercon – “eggs”
