- ### Main types of turbines
	- Descriptive
	- sl.28-31 lezen
	- Wind turbine types
		- This course covers Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT)
		- Other: Darrieus, Savonius, Gorlov
	- High altitude wind power
	- Generator types
		- Constant speed generator (first turbines)
			- Both possible with asynchronous or synchronous generators
			- Not optimal with respect to power extraction etc.
				- Can sometimes act as a fan
		- Variable speed with asynchronous generator
			- DFIG: Doubly Fed Induction Generator
			- Asynchronous generator and gearbox (Dominant generator today)
			- Generator with direct drive
				- No gearbox
				- Enercon – “eggs”
	- Notes
		- Nowadays all turbines turn clockwise (as standardization)
- ### Betz theory and wind turbine design
	- $$P_{max} = \frac{16}{27}\left(\frac{\rho U_\infty^3}{2}\right)A$$
	- **Betz limit Derivation**
		- See notes
	- **Discussion**
		- Beat the Betz limit?
			- Betz limit only valid for open turbines
				- For gas turbines higher powers are possible
				- You can build structure around it to try and beat it (but is just a big gas turbine in its limits)
			- Why should you?
				- Small thrust reduction (small decrease of $$a$$) and you don't need such a strong foundation (thrust$$\times$$lever-> big foundation needed)
				- Also economical aspect (reduce CapEx)
		- Main assumptions
			- ==Incompressible flow==
				- No flows are perfectly incompressible in reaility
				- Mach number: $$M=\frac{u}{c}$$ is maximaal $$= \frac{25}{340}<0.1$$ -> justified
				- Subtlety tip of the blade do move at 70m/s
			- ==Uniform flow losses==
				- Atmospheric flow can be complex
			- ==Inviscid flow==
				- No flows are perfectly inviscid
				- In general in and around turbine flow will be turbulent and viscosity will play a role
				- But Betz is reasonably okay (±some errors)
			- ==Conservation of angular momentum ignored==
				- Only axial momentum was accounted for, not that...
				- ...Of air that rotates the blades (and generates the torque that generates the power), that will be rotated in the oposite direction (action-reation)
				- But two are coupled through the pressure:
					- radial pressure gradient because of centrifugal forces will act axial behind the blades...
				- But Betz still valid -> why?
					- The change of angular momentum $$\frac{dL}{dt}=T$$
						- Dit klein, dus kleine T betekent grote $$\omega$$ bij zelfde vermogen ($$P=T\omega$$)
						- Because we don't want to use a lot of material -> high $$\omega$$ needed, therefore Betz still valid
	- **Rotating blade Derivation**
		- See notes
		- Notes
			- Wind turbine in action
				- one blade turbine needs counterweight (otherwise vibrations)
				- Helocoidal vortex
				- -> tip vortex (Caused by pressure difference that creates the lift is connected)
					- Downwash on the wings
				- Correction added by Prandtl
		- Prandtl's tip loss factor
			- If the axial flow induction factor a is large at the blade position then, by Equation (3.42), the inflow angle $$\phi$$ will be small and the lift force will be almost normal to the rotor plane. The component of the lift force in the tangential direction will be small and so will be its contribution to the torque. A reduced torque means reduced power and this reduction is known as tip loss because the effect occurs only at the outermost parts of the blades.
			- Conceptually, the discs, travelling axially with velocity $$U_\infty(1-a)$$ would encounter the unattenuated free-stream velocity $$U_\infty$$ at their outer edges.
			- The fast flowing free-stream air would tend to weave in and out between successive discs. The wider apart successive discs the deeper, radially, the free-stream air would penetrate.
			- Taking any line parallel to the rotor axis at a radius $$r$$, somewhat smaller than the wake radius (rotor radius), the average axial velocity along that line would be greater than $$U_\infty(1-a)$$ and less than $$U_\infty$$.
			- Let the average velocity be $$U_\infty(1-a)f(r)$$, where $$f(r)$$ is the tip-loss function, has a value less than unity and falls to zero at the wake boundary.
		- Account for drag
			- (For glider planes:) L/D determines descent angle
			- L/D high -> $$\lambda_{max} \nearrow $$
			- For a fixed chord length $$c$$
		- Typical WT performance
			- Betz limit sets upper bound
			- Amount of blades: $$N\nearrow \rightarrow \lambda \nearrow$$
			- losses
				- Airfoil drag (at high $$\lambda$$)
				- Finite number of blades
					- More severe at lower $$\lambda$$
				- Wake loss
					- Energy going into rotation of the wake
