- ### Main types of turbines
	- Descriptive
	- sl.28-31 lezen
	- Wind turbine types
		- This course covers Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT)
		- Other: Darrieus, Savonius, Gorlov
	- High altitude wind power
	- Generator types
		- Constant speed generator (first turbines)
			- Both possible with asynchronous or synchronous generators
			- Not optimal with respect to power extraction etc.
				- Can sometimes act as a fan
		- Variable speed with asynchronous generator
			- DFIG: Doubly Fed Induction Generator
			- Asynchronous generator and gearbox (Dominant generator today)
			- Generator with direct drive
				- No gearbox
				- Enercon – “eggs”
	- Notes
		- Nowadays all turbines turn clockwise (as standardization)
- ### Betz theory and wind turbine design
	- $$P_{max} = \frac{16}{27}\left(\frac{\rho U_\infty^3}{2}\right)A$$
	- **Derivation**
		- See notes
	- Discussion
		- Beat the Betz limit?
			- Betz limit only valid for open turbines
				- For gas turbines higher powers are possible
				- You can build structure around it to try and beat it (but is just a big gas turbine in its limits)
			- Why should you?
				- Small thrust reduction (small decrease of $$a$$) and you don't need such a strong foundation (thrust$$\times$$lever-> big foundation needed)
