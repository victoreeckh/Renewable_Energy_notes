- ### Main types of turbines
	- Descriptive
	- sl.28-31 lezen
	- Wind turbine types
		- This course covers Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT)
		- Other: Darrieus, Savonius, Gorlov
	- High altitude wind power
	- Generator types
		- Constant speed generator (first turbines)
			- Both possible with asynchronous or synchronous generators
			- Not optimal with respect to power extraction etc.
				- Can sometimes act as a fan
		- Variable speed with asynchronous generator
			- DFIG: Doubly Fed Induction Generator
			- Asynchronous generator and gearbox (Dominant generator today)
			- Generator with direct drive
				- No gearbox
				- Enercon – “eggs”
	- Notes
		- Nowadays all turbines turn clockwise (as standardization)
- ### Betz theory and wind turbine design
	- $$P_{max} = \frac{16}{27}\left(\frac{\rho U_\infty^3}{2}\right)A$$
	- **Betz limit Derivation**
		- See notes
	- **Discussion**
		- Beat the Betz limit?
			- Betz limit only valid for open turbines
				- For gas turbines higher powers are possible
				- You can build structure around it to try and beat it (but is just a big gas turbine in its limits)
			- Why should you?
				- Small thrust reduction (small decrease of $$a$$) and you don't need such a strong foundation (thrust$$\times$$lever-> big foundation needed)
				- Also economical aspect (reduce CapEx)
		- Main assumptions
			- ==Incompressible flow==
				- No flows are perfectly incompressible in reaility
				- Mach number: $$M=\frac{u}{c}$$ is maximaal $$= \frac{25}{340}<0.1$$ -> justified
				- Subtlety tip of the blade do move at 70m/s
			- ==Uniform flow losses==
				- Atmospheric flow can be complex
			- ==Inviscid flow==
				- No flows are perfectly inviscid
				- In general in and around turbine flow will be turbulent and viscosity will play a role
				- But Betz is reasonably okay (±some errors)
			- ==Conservation of angular momentum ignored==
				- Only axial momentum was accounted for, not that...
				- ...Of air that rotates the blades (and generates the torque that generates the power), that will be rotated in the oposite direction (action-reation)
				- But two are coupled through the pressure:
					- radial pressure gradient because of centrifugal forces will act axial behind the blades...
				- But Betz still valid -> why?
					- The change of angular momentum $$\frac{dL}{dt}=T$$
						- Dit klein, dus kleine T betekent grote $$\omega$$ bij zelfde vermogen ($$P=T\omega$$)
						- Because we don't want to use a lot of material -> high $$\omega$$ needed, therefore Betz still valid
