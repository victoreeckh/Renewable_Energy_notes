- ### Definitions
	- Irradiance
	  collapsed:: true
		- Radiant power flow on a horizontal surface = radiant energy flow/unit time [W/m2]
	- Irradiation
	  collapsed:: true
		- Integral of irradiation flux over any unit of time [hour, day, month, year, ...] [Wh/m2.x: x=hour, ...]
	- The global radiation G is split into 2 components:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Beam or direct (B)
		- Diffuse (D)
	- Clearness Index
	  collapsed:: true
		- = Global radiation/extraterrestrial radiation
	- Solar Constant
	  collapsed:: true
		- = Extraterrestrial irradiance of the solar beam = 1367 W/m2 (at mean solar distance)
	- Three basic sky conditions:
	  collapsed:: true
		- cloudless, partially clouded and overcast. Statistical data are available for Europe
	- Solar altitude
	  collapsed:: true
		- angular elevation of the centre of the solar disc above the horizontal plane
	- Solar azimuth
	  collapsed:: true
		- horizontal angle between the vertical plane containing the centre of the solar disc and the vertical plane running in the true north-south direction
	- Air mass
	  collapsed:: true
		- the path length which light takes through the atmosphere normalized to the shortest possible path length (that is, when the sun is directly overhead)
		- The air mass is the secant (1/cos \theta) of the angle with zenith
- ### Conditions
	- Cloudless
		- Global irradiation is function of
			- Latitude of the site
			- Clarity of the atmosphere
			  collapsed:: true
				- Described by the Linke Turbidity Factor
					- dust, pollution, humidity decrease beam irradiation and increase the diffuse component
					- Beam irradiance increases with decreasing Linke Turbidity factor
					- Diffuse irradiance decreases with decreasing Linke Turbidity factor
					- Global irradiance increases with decreasing Linke Turbidity factor
	- Partially clouded
		- Direct beam irradiance is very variable
			- Drastic changes in a few seconds
			- Short-term variations in diffuse radiation are smaller
		- Is important for the design of the PV-system
	- Overcast
		- No direct beam
		- Influenced by height, type and depth of clouds
		- Short-term variations are far less than with partially clouded skies
		- Overcast cloud transmittance relative to clear sky values
- ### Photovoltaics
	- Structure
		- Solar cell
		  collapsed:: true
			- Basic building block
		- Solar module
		  collapsed:: true
			- Smallest useful unit
		- String
		  collapsed:: true
			- Number of PV modules in series
		- Array
		  collapsed:: true
			- Number of strings
		- PV system
		  collapsed:: true
			- Arrays
			- + Balance-of-System
				- Electronics (+storage) + wiring + support structures + Labour

	- Performance
		- Power (of cells, modules and systems) in watt-peak (Wp)
		  collapsed:: true
			- typically 200-300 Wp/module
		- Efficiency (of cells, modules and systems) in %
		  collapsed:: true
			- typically 10-20%
		- Performance ratio
			- (average) ac efficiency / STC dc efficiency of modules or system (typically 0.8 with STC = Standard Test Conditions)
		- Electricity yield in kWh / Wp (usually per year)
		  collapsed:: true
			- (BE, NL: typically 0.75-0.95 kWh/WpÂ·yr)
		- Capacity factor
		  collapsed:: true
			- equivalent # hours ac peak power per year / # hours in a year (NL, BE: typically 9%)
