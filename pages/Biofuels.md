	- Sugars & starch
	  collapsed:: true
		- ethanol
		  butanol
		  sugar- or alcohol-to-jetfuel
	- Digestible products
	  collapsed:: true
		- -> anything that can be put in anaerobic digestion
		- bio-methane
	- lignocellulose
		- = fibrous part of plant material
		  collapsed:: true
			- consists mainly of three polymeric components bound together in a complex
			  structure: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin.
		- types
			- FT (synthetic) diesel / BTL
			- bio-methanol
			- bio-DME (di-methyl ether)

			- synthetic natural gas (SNG)
			- bio-hydrogen
- ### Evolution in the past and biofuel scenarios for the future
  collapsed:: true
	- Trends
		- Global transport energy consumption continued to grow in the past decade
			- STEPS
			  collapsed:: true
				- Although alternatives (biofuels, EV) gain importance, dominance of fossil fuels remains
				- Not compatible with climate targets!
			- NZE
				- While demand of transport services more than doubles, biofuels complement end-use efficiency and strong growth in electricity (and derived fuels), providing ~16% of transport final energy demand in 2050
				- Evolutions in road transport sectors
				  collapsed:: true
					- Strong growth of electricity (particularly for cars), but it takes time to replace the fleet
					- Biofuels have a strong role to displace fossils in the coming decade (in ICE dominated fleet)
					- In future this will be complemented with hydrogen- based fuels (‘e-fuels’)
				- Global biofuels production
				  collapsed:: true
					- Liquid biofuels to quadruple
					- Up to 2030 (main focus still on road transport):
					  collapsed:: true
						- Continued growth of conventional
						  ethanol & biodiesel
						- Strong growth of advanced biofuels
						  needed (mainly for road transport)
					- Post 2030
					  collapsed:: true
						- Role of conventional biofuels goes down
						- Addition of carbon capture & storage in biofuel processes
						- Shift from road biofuels to marine and aviation fuels (as road transport becomes more electric)
		- Two main biofuels at the moment: bio-ethanol & biodiesel
		  collapsed:: true
			- increase in the last two decades
			- Still crop dependent
				- Dominant feedstocks Ethanol:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Brazil: sugar cane
					- USA: corn
					- Europe: corn, wheat, sugar beet
				- Dominant feedstocks Biodiesel:
				  collapsed:: true
					- EU: rapeseed oil, palm oil, used
					  cooking oil, soybean oil
					- USA/Brazil: soybean oil
					- SE Asia: palm oil
- ### Application of biofuels in vehicles
	- #### Engines
		- Spark ignition engines (Otto)
		  collapsed:: true
			- compatible fuel types
				- Ethanol / ETBE
				- Methanol / MTBE
				- ...
		- Compression ignition (CI) engines (diesel)
		  collapsed:: true
			- compatible fuel types
				- Biodiesel (FAME)
				- Hydrotreated veg. oil (HVO)
		- Gas turbines (jet engines)
		  collapsed:: true
			- Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK)
				- HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids)
	- #### Alcohol biofuels
		- Methanol, ethanol, butanol
		- Properties
		  collapsed:: true
			- Lower LHV
				- → higher volumetric fuel consumption => lower radius with same tank volume
				- → lower LHV usually links with fuel oxygen content
			- Lower stoichiometric air/fuel ratio
				- -> more fuel injection per engine cycle => increased power
			- High octane number
				- → suitable for SI engines;
				- → higher compression ratio possible
			- High heat of vaporisation
				- → lower cylinder inlet temperature → better charging, higher power → potential cold start problems
		- **Ethanol applications**
			- ==As a blending component==
			- ==High ethanol concentration==
			- ==Ethanol blending in diesel==
			- ==Diesel engine with high ethanol concentration==
