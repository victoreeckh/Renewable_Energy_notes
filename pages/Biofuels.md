- ### Evolution in the past and biofuel scenarios for the future
  collapsed:: true
	- Trends
		- Global transport energy consumption continued to grow in the past decade
			- STEPS
			  collapsed:: true
				- Although alternatives (biofuels, EV) gain importance, dominance of fossil fuels remains
				- Not compatible with climate targets!
			- NZE
				- While demand of transport services more than doubles, biofuels complement end-use efficiency and strong growth in electricity (and derived fuels), providing ~16% of transport final energy demand in 2050
				- Evolutions in road transport sectors
				  collapsed:: true
					- Strong growth of electricity (particularly for cars), but it takes time to replace the fleet
					- Biofuels have a strong role to displace fossils in the coming decade (in ICE dominated fleet)
					- In future this will be complemented with hydrogen- based fuels (‘e-fuels’)
				- Global biofuels production
				  collapsed:: true
					- Liquid biofuels to quadruple
					- Up to 2030 (main focus still on road transport):
					  collapsed:: true
						- Continued growth of conventional
						  ethanol & biodiesel
						- Strong growth of advanced biofuels
						  needed (mainly for road transport)
					- Post 2030
					  collapsed:: true
						- Role of conventional biofuels goes down
						- Addition of carbon capture & storage in biofuel processes
						- Shift from road biofuels to marine and aviation fuels (as road transport becomes more electric)
		- Two main biofuels at the moment: bio-ethanol & biodiesel
		  collapsed:: true
			- increase in the last two decades
			- Still crop dependent
				- Dominant feedstocks Ethanol:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Brazil: sugar cane
					- USA: corn
					- Europe: corn, wheat, sugar beet
				- Dominant feedstocks Biodiesel:
				  collapsed:: true
					- EU: rapeseed oil, palm oil, used
					  cooking oil, soybean oil
					- USA/Brazil: soybean oil
					- SE Asia: palm oil
- ### Application of biofuels in vehicles
	- #### Engines
		- Spark ignition engines (Otto)
		  collapsed:: true
			- compatible fuel types
				- Ethanol / ETBE
				- Methanol / MTBE
				- ...
		- Compression ignition (CI) engines (diesel)
		  collapsed:: true
			- compatible fuel types
				- Biodiesel (FAME)
				- Hydrotreated veg. oil (HVO)
		- Gas turbines (jet engines)
		  collapsed:: true
			- Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK)
				- HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids)
	- #### Alcohol biofuels
		- Methanol, ethanol, butanol
		- Properties
			- Lower LHV
			  collapsed:: true
				- → higher volumetric fuel consumption => lower radius with same tank volume
				- → lower LHV usually links with fuel oxygen content
			- Lower stoichiometric air/fuel ratio
			  collapsed:: true
				- -> more fuel injection per engine cycle => increased power
			- High octane number
			  collapsed:: true
				- → suitable for SI engines;
				- → higher compression ratio possible
			- High heat of vaporisation
			  collapsed:: true
				- → lower cylinder inlet temperature → better charging, higher power → potential cold start problems
		- **Ethanol applications** #.ol
			- ==As a blending component==
			  collapsed:: true
				- Up to 10% ethanol with gasoline (“E5” or “E10”):
				- Applied as ‘oxygenate’ to lower exhaust emissions
				- No technical problems in terms of
					- power and efficiency,
					- material compatibility,
					- lubricating oil degradation
				- Avoid water => very dry ethanol
					- Water could result in phase separation
				- Increased vapour pressure of the gasoline-ethanol blend
					- could increase evaporative emissions, unless captured by canistor
				- Application of ETBE (oxygenate, produced from ethanol + iso-butylene) => reduced vapour pressure
			- ==High ethanol concentration==
			  collapsed:: true
				- Typically up to 85% ethanol (E85), sometimes also E100 (Brazil)
				- For the same energy: fuel supply (volume) x 1,6
					- => Implication on fuel tank, tubes, injection system, engine control
				- High heat of vaporisation
					- => Heating system or limited gasoline component (typically 15-30%)
				- Higher compression ratio
					- =>More power, higher efficiency
				- Material compatibility => dedicated materials
					- rubbers and plastics: avoid problems of swelling, permeability
					- metal corrosion (e.g. fuel tank)
				- Practical example: FFV technology
				  collapsed:: true
					- “Flexible Fuel Vehicles”
					- Flexibility between 100% gasoline and 85% ethanol (in Brazil 100%
					  ethanol)
					- All materials compatible with ethanol, sufficient sizing of tubes and injectors
					- Engine control unit detects type of fuel and adapts parameters (injection quantity, ignition timing), without interference of the driver
					- Engineering mainly in the engine control software
					- Also applicable for methanol in some cases
			- ==Ethanol blending in diesel==
				- Tests with up to 15% ethanol in diesel (‘E-diesel’)
				- Problems with mixability
					- => stabilising additives
				- Low cetane number
					- => ignition improvers
			- ==Diesel engine with high ethanol concentration== #.ol
				- Ethanol with ignition improvers (e.g. ED95)
					- Engine to be adapted (see Scania)
					- Very low NOx and PM emissions
				- Dual-Fuel principal
					- two fuel systems
					- Diesel pilot injection for ignition
				- Conversion to Otto engine
					- sparkplugs, lubricating additives, lower compression ratio
