- ### Evolution in the past and biofuel scenarios for the future
	- Trends
		- Global transport energy consumption continued to grow in the past decade
			- STEPS
				- Although alternatives (biofuels, EV) gain importance, dominance of fossil fuels remains
				- Not compatible with climate targets!
			- NZE
				- While demand of transport services more than doubles, biofuels complement end-use efficiency and strong growth in electricity (and derived fuels), providing ~16% of transport final energy demand in 2050
		- Two main biofuels at the moment: bio-ethanol & biodiesel
			- increase in the last two decades
			- Still crop dependent
				- Dominant feedstocks Ethanol:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Brazil: sugar cane
					- USA: corn
					- Europe: corn, wheat, sugar beet
				- Dominant feedstocks Biodiesel:
				  collapsed:: true
					- EU: rapeseed oil, palm oil, used
					  cooking oil, soybean oil
					- USA/Brazil: soybean oil
					- SE Asia: palm oil
