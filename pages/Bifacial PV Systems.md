- Intro
	- LCOE
		- $$LCOE = \frac{Sum\; of\; costs\; over\; lifetime}{Sum\; of\; electrical\; energy\; produced\; over lifetime}$$
		- Global grid parity is almost reached: $$LCOE_{PV} = LCOE_{conventional\; resources}$$
		- Increasing need towards accurate Energy Yield modelling, instead of subsidies
	- Mono->bifacial cell
		- until 5y ago: Aluminium backsurface cell was dominant
		- Now: PERC/PERT (Passivated emitter and rear cell/totally diffused) is the standard
			- Contact grid both on the front and the rear side (<-> continuous sheet of electrode)
			- Suitable for light reception from the rear side (-> higher electricity output)
		- Reasonable cost
			- Because efficiency and manufacturing is similar to monofacial cells
