- Intro
	- LCOE
	  collapsed:: true
		- $$LCOE = \frac{Sum\; of\; costs\; over\; lifetime}{Sum\; of\; electrical\; energy\; produced\; over lifetime}$$
		- Global grid parity is almost reached: $$LCOE_{PV} = LCOE_{conventional\; resources}$$
		- Increasing need towards accurate Energy Yield modelling, instead of subsidies
	- Mono->bifacial cell
	  collapsed:: true
		- until 5y ago
			- Aluminium backsurface cell was dominant
		- Now
			- PERC/PERT (Passivated emitter and rear cell/totally diffused) is the standard
			- Contact grid both on the front and the rear side (<-> continuous sheet of electrode)
			- Suitable for light reception from the rear side (-> higher electricity output)
		- Future
			- ITRPV (International Technology Roadmap for Photovoltaic) predicts high BIPV market share increase
			- adoption and deployment is slowed due to lack of track record & uncertain Energy Yield
		- Reasonable cost
			- Because efficiency and manufacturing is similar to monofacial cells
- Light collection #.ol
  collapsed:: true
	- Direct (front)
	- Sky diffuse (front)
	- Sky diffuse (back)
	- Ground-reflected sky diffuse
	- Ground-reflected direct
- Hard to predict
  collapsed:: true
	- No consensus on gain estimates
	- A lot of uncertainty
		- Rear irradiance on rear side in non-uniform
		- dependent on:
			- characteristics of the ground
			- Shading
			- Location and stance of the modules
			- Neighbouring PV systems
- Energy Yield modelling
	- Step 1: calculate irradiance on faces
		- Possible simplifications:
			- 2D instead of 3D
			- Model only middle module of row/array (common for thermal-electrical calculation)
			- Ignore frame and structure
			- Reduce time resolution
			- Use annual average sky
		- Methods
			- ==View Factor==
				- Formula : $$\frac{1}{A_1}\int_{A_1}\int_{A_2}\frac{cos\theta_1 cos\theta_2}{\pi s^2}dA_2dA_1$$
				- the fraction of radiation leaving surface A1 that strikes surface A2 directly
				- Purely geometrical parameter representing the effect of relative orientation
				- Assumes: uniform radiation in all directions, diffuse surfaces
				- Mostly applied to simplified geometries in 2D or 3D
				- (+) Low computing costs for simplified geometries
			- ==Ray tracing==
				- Start from detailed description of 3D geometry (CAD)
	- Step 2: Compute Electrical output of cells/modules/system
