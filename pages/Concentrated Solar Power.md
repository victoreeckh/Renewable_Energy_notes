- ### Direct Normal Irradiance - DNI
	- DNI = *incoming radiation energy per m^2 orthogonal to rays, per year*
	- Hotspots
		- MENA
		- (less) Southern EU
		- (Even less in) Middle EU countries
- ### CSP Solar Receiver Technologies
	- Categories
		- Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR)
			- Long rows of flat or slightly curved mirrors (mimic total parabolic shape) to reflect the sun's rays onto a downward-facing linear, fixed receiver
				- (+) Simple design (no HT) -> low investment cost
				- (-) less efficient
		- Central Receiver or Solar Tower
		- Parabolic Trough
			- Parallel rows of mirrors curved in one dimension to focus the sun's rays. Stainless steel pipes with a selective coating serve as the heat collectors.  Synthetic oil is heat transfer fluid, in the heat exchanger water is superheated that runs the turbine.
				- (+) mature
				- (-) no thermal storage
		- Parabolic Dish
	- Classification
		- Fixed vs mobile
		- Linear and point focus types
