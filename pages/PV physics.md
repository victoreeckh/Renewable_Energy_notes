- #### Diode under illumination: qualitative
	- First equilibrium concentration of carriers in both conduction and valence band (determined by intrinsic concentration )
	- Photovoltaic effect
		-
		- light is absorbed, causing excitation of (an electron or other) charge carrier to a higher-energy state
- Diode under illumination: quantitative
- Networkmodel
- Alternative collecting junction structures
	- Heterojunctions
	- pin-structures
	- Excitonic solar cell
