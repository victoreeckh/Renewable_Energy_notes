- #### Diode under illumination: qualitative
	- First equilibrium concentration of carriers in both conduction (excited through heat e.g.) and valence band (determined by intrinsic concentration of carriers in semiconductor)
		- No external factors
	- ==Photovoltaic effect==
		- external illumination: solar light
			- penetratrion of photons (depth is function of absorption coefficient)
		- absorption of fotons, causing excitation of charge carrier (electrons) to a higher-energy state
			- holes in valence band
			- free electrons in conduction band
			- ->recombination
				- conversion: heat-> heat
		- Solve by separation
			- Use p-n junction (inherent potential difference) to establish potential difference
			- Electrical field in the depletion layer
	- Photovoltaic cell
		- rear side: metal cover
			- to close system
		- front: fingerstructure
			- let light penetrate
			- in between contacts
	- Diode in the dark
		- Diode at zero voltage
			- Thermal equilibrium
				- Diffusion of few majority carriers from n->p
				- Balanced by drift current: thermally generated minority carriers which drift from p->n
		- Diode at forward voltage
			- Potential barrier decreased with $$qV$$
			- Diffusion of many majority carriers from n->p
			- Exponential increase $$I_D>I_{drift}$$
		- Diode at reverse voltage
