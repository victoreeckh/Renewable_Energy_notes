- #### Diode under illumination: qualitative
	- First equilibrium concentration of carriers in both conduction (excited through heat e.g.) and valence band (determined by intrinsic concentration of carriers in semiconductor)
		- No external factors
	- Photovoltaic effect
		- external illumination: solar light
			- penetratrion of photons (depth is function of absorption coefficient)
		- absorption of fotons, causing excitation of charge carrier (electrons) to a higher-energy state
			- holes in valence band
			- free electrons in conduction band
			- ->recombination (conversion: heat-> heat)
		- Solve by separation
