	- #### Perspective
	  collapsed:: true

			- 2012: Very big range
			- 2018: 15-25% (realistically, by Peak)
- ### Conversion Technology
	- #### Direct Combustion
		- = *Thermo-chemical process releasing heat*
		- $C_aH_b + Ox \rightarrow CO_2+H_2O +heat$
			- Use heat directly or convert to electricity with steam generators (Rankine cycle)
		- E.g.
			- wood stoves for heat generation
			- waste incinerators for electricity and/or heat generation
		- Interesting applications
			- Interesting route could be cofiring / co-combustion with coal in regions with ample recent investments in coal-fired plants (China, India)
	- #### Conversion to secondary energy carrier
		- Categories
			- thermo chemical
			- physico chemical
			- bio chemical
				- = decomposition of organic matter by means of micro organisms
					- (An)aerobic = with(out) $O_2$
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1682706909139_0.png){:height 301, :width 429}
		- Major processes
			- **Thermo-chemical-gasification**
				- Thermo-chemical = *decomposition of biomass by means of heat*
					- resulting secondary energy carrier later on to be used in combustion process
				- Gasification = *sub-stoechiometric oxidation of biomass*
					- Amount of oxygen we add is lower than for a full oxidation (partial oxidation)
					- Mainly using heat (globally endothermic)
					- Aim to generate a gas that is still combustible ($CO, H_2$ = Syngas)
					  collapsed:: true
						- producer gas, cleaned to synthesis gas = syngas, usable in CHP
				- Systems/installations
					- ==BIG-STIG== (=biomass-integrated gasifier/steam injected gas turbine)
					  collapsed:: true
						- Most advanced system
						- part of steam produced in heat recovery boiler injected in gas turbine to boost efficiency
						- power values 2-5 MWe
					- ==IGCC== (Integrated gasification combined cycle)
					  collapsed:: true
						- for large-scale installations
						- Also called BIGCC
						- Process (3 places where energy is generated)
						  collapsed:: true
							- gasifier $Q_{produced} \rightarrow$ steam turbine (1)
							- Synthesis gas $\rightarrow$ in gas turbine (2)
							- Exhaust gases turbine $Q \rightarrow$ steam cycle (3)
						- Advantages/disadvantages
						  collapsed:: true
							- (+)  easily capture CO2 (but then need to develop H2 gas turbines)
							  collapsed:: true
								- leads to negative CO2 emissions when BIGCC
							- (+/-) BIGCCs can benefit from experience with coal-fired IGCCs, but currently not too many IGCCs built
							- (-) Major problem: gas cleaning purification
			- **Biochemical Fermentation**
				- Alcohol fermentation
					- production of ethanol $C_2H_5OH$ from start from biomass with starch or sugars (sugar beets, sugar cane, wheat)
					  id:: 644c1f0a-27fa-428d-8060-dca358bb89e4
			- Aerobic digestion
			  collapsed:: true
				- = *"Composting"*
				- used as “waste treatment” of GFT/VFG
				- while composting, “heat” is released together with CO2, H2O, (NH3 and S-compounds), but no other valuable side-products : No CH4
			- **Anaerobic digestion/ "gasification"**
				- decomposition organic material in absence of O2
				- produces mixture of CO2 and CH4 (biogas)
				- Although bacteria produce heat, often necessary to add heat to keep T ≥ 35° C (even when exothermic)
				  collapsed:: true
					- Sometimes necessary to recycle all gas produced -> no net energy “production”
				- DRANCO
				  collapsed:: true
					- Dry Anaerobic Composting
					- developed in Flanders in 19-eighties
					- anaerobic digestion phase: CO2 + CH4
					- Aerobic composting phase → compost
					- Sources: GFT/VFG, de-watered sludge, paper, industrial waste
					- $T \approx 50^{\circ}C$
- ### Energy Content
	- Crops
		- Indicators
			- Energy production per ha $[GJ/ha-a]$
			- Heating value $[GJ/ton]$
			- energy-out/energy-in
			- bulk density $$[kg/m^3]$$
			- (Low) heating value $$[GJ/t]$$
				- Energy released when full product is oxidized, but water is still in vapor phase (if condensed -> extra condensation heat -> HHV)
- ### Waste
	- #### Organic waste streams

			- technical potential Flanders ~ 100 GWhe/a
		- Agricultural waste
			- straw
				- Belgium is importer
			- manure
				- Dry matter fraction important
			- technical potential Flanders ~ 770 GWhe/a
		- VFG
			- VFG/GFT + “green” residue
				- mostly invested in aerobic compostation installations → likely to be used; no energetic potential left
				- Heating Value ~ 9 GJ/ton
			- remaining household waste
				- even with “selective collection”, organic-biologic fraction of household waste remains quite high
				- Heating Value ~ 4 GJ/ton
	- #### Import of biomass
		- Zero yield transport distance
			- the distance over which a fossil-fueled vehicle emits as much CO2 as the CO2 contents of the biomass
			- $\leq 600km$ for trucks
			- $\leq 2000$ for ships
	- #### Waste Issue
		- Landfill gas recovery
			- gas produced by anaerobic digestion of landfill waste
			- Composition: $CH_4 (\sim 40-60\%)+CO_2 (\sim 60-40\%)$
			- Heating value: $15-22MJ/Nm^3$
			- See evolution (slide 66)
