- ### Introduction
	- Generations
		- 1-st generation: bio mass also used for food supply
		- 2-nd generation: “woody” (ligno cellulosic) biomass and waste recovery
		- 3-rd generation: genetically modified crops, algae
		- Old classification (now advanced biomass)
	- Types
		- Bioethanol
			- Lower energy content compared to gasoline -> lower energy density -> more quantity required
		- Corn ethanol
			- Energy balance: 1.3 (Low)
			- Emissions: $-22\%$
		- Cane Ethanol
			- Energy balance: 8 (Higher)
			- Emissions: $-56\%$
		- Cellulosic ethanol
			- Energy balance: 2-36 (High range depending on production method)
			- Emissions: $-91\%$
		- Biodiesel
			- Energy balance: 2.5
			- Emissions: $-68\%$
		- Algae
		- Palmoil
			- Expropriation of rain forest; drying of wetlands, loss of biodiversity, etc.
